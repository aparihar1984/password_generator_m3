Module 3 Password Generator Assignment

## Introduction
For this assignment, we were required to create an application that can be used to generate a strong and secure random password based on criteria that has been selected by the user. The Password Generator features HTML and CSS pages powered by JavaScript code.

## Criteria
To meet the accepted criteria of this assignment, I created a password generator using a JavaScript file that featured the following:

After clicking the button to generate a password, the user is presented with a series of prompts for the password criteria.

When prompted for the password criteria, the user can select which criteria to include in the password.

When prompted for the length of the password, the user can choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters for the password.

When asked for character types to include in the password, the user can decide whether or not to include lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and certain special characters.

When all the prompts have been answered, a password is generated that matches the criteria selected by the user.

## References

To complete this assignment I first cloned the given code/GitHub Repository "https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet" as the starter code.  Then I studied the following activities from the Module 3-JavaScript Class File as references for this Assignment:

"05-Ins_Primitive-Types" 
"07-Ins_Logical-Comparison-Operators" 
"15-Ins_Functions"
"21-Ins_Objects"
"22-Stu_Objects"

After this, I searched the internet for further information for the password generator and came across the following website:

"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65668295/pass-an-object-methods-and-call-those-methods-outside-of-function-random-passwo"

The process of coding for me involved using code from the activities and the website and commenting out every section of code in the JavaScript file to see what each specific block of code accomplished. This led to a lot of experimentation in order to see what I felt was needed to ultimately complete the Acceptance Criteria of the assignment.

The experimentation was necessary since it should be pointed out that while the code given on the above referenced website was very helpful, the code given DOES NOT completely function properly or accomplish everything that was asked for in the Acceptance Criteria.

## Screenshots

Here are the screenshots from when I entered that I wanted 5 digits in the password:
